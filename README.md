# random word generator

A small and flexible pseudorandom word generator using a markov chain.

- in.py:
```
usage: in.py [-h] (-o FILE | -r FILE FILE | -w FILE) file_loc

analyses file and creates a JSON file used by out.py

positional arguments:
  file_loc      path to text file you want to analyze

optional arguments:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
  -o FILE       reads data from FILE and overwrites it, if the file does not
                exist it will be created
  -r FILE FILE  reads data from first arg and writes to the second
  -w FILE       writes to FILE
```

- out.py:
```
usage: out.py [-h] [-a A | -r R R] [-m M | -l L] file_loc

generates pseudo random words based on a file generated by in.py

positional arguments:
  file_loc    the path to the .json file generated by in.py

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -a A        generates a set amount of pseudo random words
  -r R R      a random amount of words between the bounds given ([a,b[)
  -m M        set a minimum for the word length
  -l L        set a precise length for the pseudo random word
```
- saveAndLoad.py:
help class used by both in.py and out.py
- cleanup.sh:
