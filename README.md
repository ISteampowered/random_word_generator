     |  This module allows you to analyze text files, generate a JSON file with this data and generate word based
     |  on this data
     |  
     |  Static methods defined here:
     |  
     |  analyse(file_loc, datafile_name_out='', over_write=False, datafile_name_in='', give_object=False, look_back_amount=1, look_forward_amount=1)
     |      analyse a text file based on what letters follow each other
     |      :param file_loc: the path to the text file you want to analyse
     |      :param datafile_name_out: the path to the JSON file where you want the data to be written
     |      :param datafile_name_in: the path to a JSON file that you want to load before you analyse anything
     |      :param over_write: write the data to the JSON FILE where you read the data from
     |      :param give_object: if you want the saveAndLoad object to be returned
     |      :param look_back_amount: look at the n previous characters
     |      :param look_forward_amount: look at the n next characters
     |  
     |  analyse_word_length(file_loc, datafile_name_out='', over_write=False, datafile_name_in='', give_object=False)
     |      analyze the text file based on word length
     |      :param file_loc: the path to the text file you want to analyse
     |      :param datafile_name_out: the path to the JSON file where you want the data to be written
     |      :param datafile_name_in: the path to a JSON file that you want to load before you analyse anything
     |      :param over_write: write the data to the JSON FILE where you read the data from
     |      :param give_object: if you want the saveAndLoad object to be returned
     |  
     |  generate_sentence(file_in, print_to_terminal=False, sentence_length=17, sentence_data_file='', starting_word_length=5, **extra_files)
     |      generates a sentence based on the JSON file generated by analyse
     |      :param file_in: path to the JSON file
     |      :param print_to_terminal: print sentence to terminal
     |      :param sentence_data_file: the path to the word length data file
     |      :param sentence_length: the desired length of the sentence
     |      :param starting_word_length: the length of the first word in the sentence
     |      :param extra_files: key value pairs where the key is the extra file location and the value is the weight you
     |       want to give it. The weight of file_in is one. These files may contain data with a lookback amount greater
     |       than 1
     |      :return pseudo random sentence
     |  
     |  generate_word(file_in, precise_word_length=-1, min_word_length=0, print_to_terminal=True, **extra_files)
     |      generates a random word
     |      :param file_in: path to the JSON file. This file should contain data with chunk ration of 1:1 ( if chunk length
     |      is 1 then this simply means what letter follows another)
     |      :param min_word_length: the minimum length of the word
     |      :param precise_word_length: if you want to generate words with a precise length
     |      :param print_to_terminal: print word to terminal
     |      :param extra_files: key value pairs where the key is the extra file location and the value is the weight you
     |       want to give it. The weight of file_in is one. These files may contain data with a
     |       lookback amount greater than 1
     |      :return: a pseudo random word

     |  This module allows you to save, load and add data that is useful for markov chains
     |  The file format is JSON
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, file_loc='')
     |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
     |  
     |  add(self, **tuple_values)
     |      adds a tuple value to the data
     |      :param tuple_values: The tuple values that you want to store
     |  
     |  combine_self(self, *datafiles_name_in)
     |

     |      :return: an array of values containing the keys from the dictionary associated with the given key
     |  
     |  give_lookback_amount(self)
     |      :return: N from N:M if N is the same for the whole file
